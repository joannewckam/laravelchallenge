## Brief

# Instructions:

Using Laravel as your framework, write an API that allows users to authenticate, upload a PDF document, and see a list of their (but no other user’s) documents. This API should be RESTful. Ideally, it’s fast and secure, but it doesn’t need to be perfect. If there are areas that your solution hasn’t had time to address, annotate them for future development.

-   [ X ] Authenticate user, upload a PDF document
-   [ X ] See a list of their documents (no other user’s)
-   [ X ] RESTful
-   [ X ] Fast and secure
-   [ ] Testing
-   [ ] Documentation

## Planning

Learn Laravel framework and PHP syntax in the context of a simple CRUD project.

Determine the main functionality, which is to be able to upload a PDF, display all uploaded PDFs and ensure that they are linked to that user.

Relationship with user and uploaded files is one to many. One user can have many files and many files belong to one user.

login as a user - username and password

index: list of files
create: form to upload a file
store: post to store listing in db
